## Things to change before getting started       
   
**Prerequisite:**    
- Make use you have React:  `npm install -g create-react-app`   
**Then, next steps:**    
- Clone the project using this url:  
`git clone https://github.com/Emidomenge/react-cra-wesome.git`

  `npm install`  
 - Final step ! You can run the project in localhost:
  `npm start`  
  
  **Last but not the least:**    
- You need to make some change in those files :  
   - rename `"your_app_name"`  in `public/index.html`  
   - rename `"your_app_name"` in `package.json`  
    
  ## Cool stuff out of the box :)    
    
- [React-fontawesome](https://github.com/danawoodman/react-fontawesome)    
Font awesome contains many cool icons. You will find everything you need ! ;)  
 - [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/)    
Bootstrap (v3.0) allow us to build a responsive app, create forms easily , buttons, tables, modals, etc... Take a look to their documentations :D  
 - [AirBNB eslint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb)    
**Eslint** is a script which will check your javascript files. It will tell you if you don't respect code writting conventions, styles.. Here we are following the **AirBNB conventions**, which the best readable codes, it's a little bit annoying at the beginning but very cool after ! ;)  
  
 - [Sass (.scss file)](https://sass-lang.com/)    
Sass is "CSS with superpowers". To write your css, create a ".scss" extension file instead, you can write your normal css code inside but you can also use features from Sass to build nicely your css, for example you can defined css variables. It will create automatically .css file which you linked to your js file.  
 - [Tachyons](https://github.com/tachyons-css/tachyons/)    
Tachyons is useful to avoid to build custom css class. It comes with many generic class to put directly to your react components/html tags.  
  
   For example...  
 `<div className="b w-100 red">Tachyons is amazing</div>`  
Will so the same than if you were doing a custom css class with those attributes :  
 `{font-weight:bold; color:red; width: 100%}`  
You will save time with tachyons and your code will be easily to maintain. ;)  
  
 - [react-animated-css](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-animated-css)  
To make smooth animation, useful when you needs to do animations with your javascript. For example when clicking on a button, hovering an element, etc... It use **animate.css**.  
You can have a [demo here](https://digital-flowers.github.io/react-animated-css.html).  
 - [react-animate-on-scroll](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-animate-on-scroll)  
To make smooth animation while user **is scrolling** your app. It use **animate.css**.   
**WARNING:** Use `react-animate-on-scroll` only to trigger animations when user is scrolling, use `react-animated-css` otherwise !
